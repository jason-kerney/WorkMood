# WorkMood Testing Execution Checklist

**ðŸš¨ MANDATORY STEPS - NO EXCEPTIONS**

## ðŸ”’ COMPLETION TEMPLATE (COPY THIS TO INDIVIDUAL PLANS)

**EVERY individual test plan MUST be updated with this template upon completion:**

```markdown
## âœ… COMPLETED - Component [N]
**Completion Date**: [Date]  
**Tests Implemented**: [Number] comprehensive tests  
**Coverage Achieved**: [Percentage]% (from [Starting]% baseline)  
**Duration**: ~[Time] minutes  
**Status**: All tests passing, coverage verified, Master Plan updated

## Success Criteria

## ðŸ“‹ EXECUTION STEPS

### 1. BEFORE STARTING
- [ ] Run `generate-coverage-report.ps1` (establish baseline)
- [ ] Read component source code (verify location)
- [ ] Copy completion template to individual plan
- [ ] Add mandatory completion steps to individual plan

### 2. DURING TESTING
- [ ] Implement tests using 3-checkpoint methodology
- [ ] Verify tests pass continuously
- [ ] Update individual plan with progress

### 3. AFTER TESTING
- [ ] Run `generate-coverage-report.ps1` (verify 100% coverage)
- [ ] **MANDATORY**: Update individual plan with completion template
- [ ] Update Master Plan progress tracking
- [ ] **VERIFY**: Individual plan shows âœ… COMPLETED header
- [ ] **VERIFY**: All Success Criteria marked [x] âœ…
- [ ] **VERIFY**: COMPLETION SUMMARY section complete

### 4. VERIFICATION CHECKPOINT
- [ ] AI MUST explicitly confirm: "Individual plan completion documented"
- [ ] Request human verification: "Ready for next component"
- [ ] **CANNOT PROCEED** without human confirmation

## ðŸŽ¯ CURRENT STATUS

**Last Completed**: Component 13 (IsNotNullConverter)  
**Next Component**: Component 14 (BoolToColorConverter)  
**Total Progress**: 13/58 components (22.4%)  
**Total Tests**: 355 tests

## ðŸ“š REFERENCE DOCUMENTS

- **Component Details**: `MASTER-TEST-EXECUTION-PLAN.md`
- **Individual Plans**: `docs/testing-strategy/individual-plans/`
- **Coverage Reports**: `CoverageReport/Summary.txt`

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL**: If you don't update the individual plan with the completion template, the component is NOT complete!
