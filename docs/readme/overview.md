<!-- (dl (section-meta Overview)) -->

WorkMood is a cross-platform desktop application designed to help you understand how your workday impacts your emotional state. Rather than general mood tracking, WorkMood focuses specifically on the relationship between your work environment and emotional well-being.

The application allows you to record your mood at the beginning and end of your work day, then visualizes patterns to help you identify what work situations affect your mood positively or negatively.
