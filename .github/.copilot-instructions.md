# GitHub Copilot Instructions for WorkMood

## Project Overview
WorkMood is a cross-platform desktop application for tracking work mood impact on emotional well-being. It's built as a .NET MAUI application targeting desktop platforms (Windows and macOS).

## Technology Stack
- **Framework**: .NET 9.0
- **Platform**: .NET MAUI (Multi-platform App UI)
- **Target Frameworks**: 
  - `net9.0-windows10.0.19041.0` (Windows)
  - `net9.0-maccatalyst` (macOS)
- **Language**: C#
- **UI Framework**: XAML

## Project Structure
- **Solution**: `WorkMood.sln` - Main solution file
- **Main Project**: `MauiApp/WorkMood.MauiApp.csproj` - MAUI application project
- **Documentation**: Generated using Doculisp (see `docs/` folder)

## Development Guidelines

### Building the Application
When building the MAUI application, **always specify the target framework** using the `--framework` parameter:

```bash
# For Windows development
dotnet build --framework net9.0-windows10.0.19041.0

# For macOS development  
dotnet build --framework net9.0-maccatalyst

# For publishing
dotnet publish --framework net9.0-windows10.0.19041.0  # Windows
dotnet publish --framework net9.0-maccatalyst          # macOS
```

### Architecture Patterns
The project follows a clean architecture approach with:
- **MVVM Pattern**: ViewModels in `ViewModels/` folder
- **Services**: Business logic and data access in `Services/`
- **Adapters**: Data transformation in `Adapters/`
- **Models**: Data models in `Models/`
- **Pages**: XAML views in `Pages/`
- **Infrastructure**: Base classes and utilities
- **Converters**: Value converters for XAML binding
- **Strategies**: Strategy pattern implementations

### Key Services
- `IMoodDataService`: Core mood data management
- `IMoodVisualizationService`: Data visualization
- `IScheduleConfigService`: Schedule configuration
- `ILoggingService`: Application logging
- `INavigationService`: Page navigation
- `IBrowserService`: External browser integration

### Code Style
- Use nullable reference types (enabled in project)
- Follow C# naming conventions
- Use dependency injection for service registration
- Implement proper MVVM separation of concerns

### Platform-Specific Considerations

# Watch mode for development
dotnet watch run --project WorkMood.sln
```

### Testing
- Focus on unit testing ViewModels and Services
- Consider platform-specific testing when adding new features
- Test data visualization components thoroughly

### Refactoring Methodology

This project follows a **disciplined incremental refactoring** approach, particularly for abstracting dependencies to improve testability. The following guidelines should be followed when making architectural improvements.

#### Test-Driven Refactoring
- **Prioritize automated tests**: Always run existing automated tests before and after refactoring
- **Use manual testing when necessary**: When automated test coverage is inadequate, supplement with manual testing to verify behavior (Verified by user)
- **Identify test gaps**: If manual testing is required, consider adding automated tests for better future coverage
- **Red-Green-Refactor**: Ensure all tests pass before refactoring, refactor while keeping tests green

#### Incremental Changes
- **Smallest possible increments**: Make the smallest change that provides value, preferably no larger than a single method
- **One concept at a time**: Focus on one refactoring concept per increment (e.g., extract method, rename variable, remove duplication)
- **Frequent commits**: Commit after each successful increment (verified by tests or manual testing) to maintain a safe rollback point
- **Validate each step**: Ensure each increment compiles and passes tests before proceeding

#### Refactoring Priorities
1. **Method-level changes**: Extract methods, rename parameters, simplify method logic
2. **Class-level changes**: Extract classes, move methods, improve encapsulation
3. **Architecture-level changes**: Only after smaller increments, and with comprehensive test coverage

#### Safety Practices
- **Preserve external behavior**: Refactoring should not change observable behavior
- **Maintain API contracts**: Keep public interfaces stable unless explicitly changing them
- **Update tests minimally**: Only update tests if the refactoring legitimately changes testable behavior
- **Document breaking changes**: Clearly communicate any intentional behavioral changes

## Shim Factory Refactoring Pattern

### Overview
When abstracting hard dependencies (like SkiaSharp, File I/O, etc.), use the **Shim Factory Pattern** to enable dependency injection and improve testability.

### Step-by-Step Process

#### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup
1. **Create Abstraction Interfaces** - Define `I[Type]Shim` interfaces for each dependency type
2. **Build Concrete Implementations** - Create `[Type]Shim` classes that wrap the actual dependencies  
3. **Factory Pattern** - Create `I[Factory]ShimFactory` interface and `[Factory]ShimFactory` implementation
4. **Constructor Injection** - Update service constructors to accept factory interfaces

#### Phase 2: Method-by-Method Incremental Refactoring
**CRITICAL**: Refactor ONE method at a time, following this exact sequence:

1. **Add Factory Method** - Extend factory interface with new creation method
2. **Implement Factory Method** - Add concrete implementation to factory class
3. **Refactor Target Method** - Replace direct dependency usage with factory calls
4. **Test Manually** - Verify functionality works identically (ask user to verify)
5. **Commit with Pattern** - Use consistent commit message format
6. **Repeat for Next Method** - Continue systematically

### Code Transformation Examples

#### Before (Hard Dependency):
```csharp
private void DrawBackground(SKCanvas canvas, SKRect area)
{
    using var backgroundPaint = new SKPaint
    {
        Color = SKColors.White,  // Hard-coded dependency
        Style = SKPaintStyle.Fill
    };
    canvas.DrawRect(area, backgroundPaint);
}
```

#### After (Factory Pattern):
```csharp
private void DrawBackground(SKCanvas canvas, SKRect area)
{
    DrawBackground(drawShimFacory.From(canvas), area);
}

private void DrawBackground(ICanvasShim canvas, SKRect area)
{
    using var backgroundPaint = drawShimFactory.PaintFromArgs(new PaintShimArgs
    {
        Color = drawShimFactory.WhiteColor(),  // Factory-created dependency
        Style = SKPaintStyle.Fill
    });
    canvas.DrawRect(area, backgroundPaint);
}
```

### Refactoring Targets by Priority

#### High Impact (Critical for Testing):
1. **File System Operations** - `File.WriteAllBytesAsync()`, `File.Exists()`
2. **Direct Object Creation** - `new SKBitmap()`, `new SKCanvas()`, `new SKPath()`
3. **Color Constants** - `SKColors.White`, `Colors.Blue`, etc.
4. **Font/Typography** - `SKTypeface.FromFamilyName()`, `SKFontStyle.Bold`

#### Medium Impact:
1. **Path Effects** - `SKPathEffect.CreateDash()`
2. **Paint Styles** - `SKPaintStyle.Fill`, `SKPaintStyle.Stroke`
3. **Image Encoding** - `SKEncodedImageFormat.Png`

#### Lower Impact:
1. **Geometric Objects** - `SKRect`, coordinate calculations
2. **Async Patterns** - `Task.Run()` wrapper abstractions

### Quality Gates

#### Before Each Commit:
- ✅ **Build succeeds** without errors
- ✅ **Manual testing** confirms identical behavior
- ✅ **Single responsibility** - one method/concept per commit
- ✅ **Consistent naming** - follow established factory method patterns

#### Architecture Principles:
- **Testability First** - Every abstraction should enable mocking
- **Incremental Safety** - Never break working functionality
- **Dependency Inversion** - Services depend on interfaces, not concrete types
- **Single Point of Change** - Centralize dependency creation in factories

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Big Bang Refactoring** - Don't change multiple methods simultaneously
❌ **Batch Commits** - Don't combine multiple method refactors in one commit
❌ **Breaking Changes** - Don't alter public API during internal refactoring
❌ **Skip Testing** - Don't commit without manual verification
❌ **Mixed Concerns** - Don't combine refactoring with feature changes

### Testing Strategy

#### Manual Testing Approach:
1. **Before Refactoring** - Document expected behavior
2. **After Each Change** - Verify identical visual/functional output
3. **Edge Cases** - Test boundary conditions and error scenarios
4. **Performance** - Ensure no regression in rendering performance

#### Future Unit Testing:
Once abstractions are complete, create mock factories for:
- **Color Verification** - Assert correct colors are requested
- **File Operations** - Mock file system interactions
- **Canvas Operations** - Verify drawing commands and sequences
- **Error Handling** - Test failure scenarios safely

### Documentation
- Documentation is generated using Doculisp
- Source files are in `docs/` folder
- Main documentation files: `BUILD.md`, `USER-GUIDE.md`
- Always update documentation when adding new features

## Commit Guidelines

**MANDATORY**: Always use Arlo's Commit Notation for ALL commits in this project.

### Commit Message Pattern

Use **Arlo's Commit Notation** (Risk Aware Commit Notation) with this exact format for all commits:

**Format**: `[Risk][Intention] - [Description]`

#### Risk Levels

- `.` = **Safe** (Proven) - Provable refactoring, automated tools, or test-supported procedural
- `^` = **Validated** - Test-supported procedural refactoring with full test coverage
- `!` = **Risky** - Named refactoring without full test coverage or manual verification
- `@` = **Broken** - Unfinished implementation or no verification

#### Intentions (use lowercase for 0 behavior changes)

- `r` = **Refactoring** - Change implementation without changing behavior
- `f` = **Feature** - Add new functionality (internal/developer-only)
- `F` = **Feature** - Add new user-visible functionality
- `b` = **Bugfix** - Fix internal issue
- `B` = **Bugfix** - Fix user-visible issue
- `d` = **Documentation** - Internal documentation changes

#### Refactoring Commit Examples

- `^r - extract DrawBackground to use color factory for dependency injection`
- `^r - extract DrawTitle to use ICanvasShim for dependency injection`
- `^r - remove SKCanvas overloads and use drawShimFactory for object creation`
- `.r - extract method using automated refactoring tool`

#### Other Common Examples

- `^f - add new internal API method for graph data processing`
- `^b - fix null reference in data validation logic`
- `^d - update architecture documentation for shim factory pattern`
- `!F - add new user dashboard feature (manual testing only)`

### Risk Assessment Guidelines

#### When to use each Risk Level

- **`.` (Safe)**: Only when using automated refactoring tools OR following test-supported procedural refactoring with full project test coverage
- **`^` (Validated)**: When following named refactoring patterns with adequate test coverage and manual verification
- **`!` (Risky)**: When making manual changes with limited test coverage but following established patterns
- **`@` (Broken)**: When code doesn't compile, tests fail, or functionality is incomplete

#### Default Risk Levels by Activity

- **Method-by-method refactoring**: `^r` (most common in this project)
- **Automated IDE refactoring**: `.r`
- **New internal features**: `^f`
- **Bug fixes with tests**: `^b`
- **Documentation updates**: `^d`
- **Experimental/incomplete work**: `@[intention]`

### Commit Frequency

Make **small, frequent commits** following the one-method-per-commit principle established in the refactoring methodology. Each commit should represent a single, complete, testable change.

### Important Notes
- This is a desktop-only application (no mobile targets)
- Uses local data storage (no cloud services)
- Focuses specifically on work-related mood tracking
- Application icon: `smiles.ico/png`

When suggesting code changes or new features, always consider:
1. MVVM pattern compliance
2. Proper service injection
3. Platform-specific requirements
4. Data binding best practices
5. MAUI lifecycle management
